# Credit-Card-Fault-detection
Fraudulent transactions done by your credit cards can be predicted. This model is used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. My aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.
Very few transactions are actually fraudulent hence data set is highly skewed, consisting of 492 frauds in a total of 284,807 observations thus skewness is justified by the low number of fraudulent transactions.
The dataset consists of numerical values from the 28 ‘Principal Component Analysis (PCA)’ transformed features, namely V1 to V28.
The ‘Time’ and ‘Amount’ features are not transformed data.
The dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Université Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.
